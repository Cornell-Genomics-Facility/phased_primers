# Phased Primer Designer üìäüß¨

Generate **phased PCR primers** with balanced early‚Äìcycle nucleotide diversity ‚Äî an approach that minimizes base-calling noise and phasing/pre-phasing artifacts on Illumina instruments.

## Why Phased Primers?

| Challenge on Illumina SBS | How phasing helps |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Low diversity in cycle 1‚Äì12 saturates color channels ‚Üí poor color-matrix estimation | Pre-pending a few staggered bases lets A/T/C/G appear evenly in the first cycles |
| Color over-representation (e.g. all ‚ÄúA‚Äù), especially in amplicon sequencing | Multiple phased primers are pooled so sequencer sees a balanced signal |
| Four-, two- and one-channel chemistries need different base/fluor balancing | App shows per-chemistry **color plots** to verify balance |

## App Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chemistry-aware balanced phasing algorithm** | Iteratively chooses the least-represented base for each added position, respecting degenerate IUPAC codes. |
| **Chemistry-aware color plots** | Visualise percent contribution to each color channel for: 1) Four-channel (HiSeq/MiSeq), 2) Two-channel original SBS, 3) Two-channel **XLEAP-SBS**, 4) One-channel (iSeq 100). |
| **Nucleotide composition plot** | Side-by-side bar chart of %A, %T, %C, %G. |
| **Downloadables** | ‚Ä¢ `nucleotide_percentages_plot.png`  ‚Ä¢ `color_percentages_plot.png`  ‚Ä¢ `phased_primers.csv` (adapter + phasing + gene-specific) |
| **Multi-user public link** | Hosted on HF Spaces; each browser session is isolated. |

## Illumina Chemistry

Illumina currently ships **four distinct sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) chemistries**:

| Chemistry | Instruments | Color logic | Compatibility rule |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Four-channel** | HiSeq, MiSeq | Red laser detects **A/C**, green laser detects **G/T** | Each cycle must contain **‚â•1 red** **and** **‚â•1 green** signal |
| **Two-channel (original SBS)** | NovaSeq 6000 (S1‚ÄìS4 flow cells), NextSeq 550, MiniSeq | **A/C = red**, **A/T = green**, **G = no color** | Each cycle must show **any color signal** (red/green) |
| **Two-channel (XLEAP-SBS)** | NovaSeq X/X-Plus | **A/C = blue**, **T/C = green**, **G = no color** | Require ‚Äú‚â•1 green pixel‚Äù rule; **indices starting with GG are incompatible** |
| **One-channel** | iSeq 100 | Fluor mixing encoded in image intensity, not color | No color check; require **‚â•1 A or C or T** per cycle |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Always consult the latest Illumina documentation when designing index or primer pools for a specific platform.

The app renders a **color-balance plot** for each chemistry so you can verify compatibility before ordering primers.
